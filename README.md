# Open Library search tests

This project tests book search on [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org) with
Playwright and TypeScript. It covers the search results page, the Search API,
and mocked responses for cases that are difficult to reproduce reliably against
the live site.

## Running the tests

```sh
npm run test
```

To run one part of the suite:

```sh
npm run test:ui
npm run test:api
npm run test:mocks
```

Playwright saves its HTML report in `playwright-report/`. After a run, open it
with:

```sh
npm run report
```

Failed tests retain screenshots and traces to help with debugging.

## How the tests work

The UI tests search for “The Hobbit”, check the first five result cards, and
compare a bounded sample of API titles with visible UI results. They normalize
titles before comparing them because the catalog and its relevance ranking can
change; the tests don't expect the UI and API to return results in exactly the
same order.

The API tests check the response shape, titles, optional author names, empty
searches, and two consecutive pages. Pagination checks that each page respects
the requested limit and that work keys don't repeat when present.

## Search page and network mocks

Open Library renders its search results in the HTML document returned by
`GET /search?q=...`. The result cards use `.searchResultItem`, with titles in
`.booktitle a` and author details in `.bookauthor` when available. During
inspection, the populated page did not fetch `/search.json`; that endpoint is
covered separately by the API tests. The live empty-search page displayed
“No matching books or authors”.

The mock tests intercept only search-page navigations and return HTML using the
same result-card structure. They cover two books (one without an author), an
empty result, and a `500` response. Each test checks that the request was
intercepted and verifies what appeared in the page. The route is removed after
each test, so it cannot affect live tests.

Calls to the Search API go through a shared helper. It queues those requests
and spaces their start times by at least one second, rather than adding sleeps
to individual tests.
